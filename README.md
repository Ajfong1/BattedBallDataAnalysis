 Analyzed batted ball data by organizing given statistical data on Exit Velocity (EV) and Launch Angle (LA) for different hit types (e.g., ground balls, fly balls, line drives, popups). Using R, I calculated summary statistics and visualized key metrics through scatterplots and relative frequency bar charts. These visualizations highlight how individual player performance (organized by batter ID) compares to dataset averages. The project promotes user accessibility by allowing interactive input to query specific players and hit types. This allows for analysis to be practical, shareable, and adaptable.
